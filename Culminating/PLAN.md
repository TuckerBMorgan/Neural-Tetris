  - Implement RELU activation function
  - Set a limit to the gradient to prevent it from exploding
  - Implement training and testing
  - Implement neural network training visualization
  - Should train on the MNIST dataset with a testing error of less than 5%
- A functioning convolutional neural network class that can take in inputs and accurately predict new outputs
  - Learn about convolutional neural networks
  - Plan out a good software architecture for the convolutional network so that it is easy to work with and extend
  - Should train on the MNIST dataset with a testing error of less than 5%
  - Implement forward network pass
  - Implement backwards network pass
  - Implement error visualization
  - Implement test set
  - Implement mini batch
